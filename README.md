# R2-Keeping-Track-Of-Things
A Simple Todo List, made using SwiftUI.


## My Process

* I began this project in React Native; however, shortly after IOS 15 was introduced. With it, there was a variety of new features added to Xcode and SwiftUI. So, I decided to switch over to that. Swift is one of the languages I'm most comfortable in so it wasn't that difficult for me to write this program, but as I'm sure you noticed, the "Weekly Planner" only adds tasks to Monday in its current generation. In the future, I'd like to take a more object-oriented approach to this project and create functionality for the whole week. To add something a little different to my app, I switched the scrolle direction to horizontal which I feel creates a better looking UI and allowed the user to switch the color of a given Todo. 
* Note: If you'd like to also see the start of my React project as well for my process, let me know!
